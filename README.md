# Design Team Project

This outlines a recent problem we ran into and came up with a design solution for. We'd like to see how you would handle it. What is most important is gaining some insight into your design process.

## Background
[BriteCore](http://www.britecore.com/) is a web-based platform insurance companies use to manage their business. An inevitable part of the insurance process is Claims Management. A claim occurs when a policyholder experiences a loss, such as a house fire or burglary. Insurance companies have entire departments whose job it is to manage claims. 

## Problem
Having a responsive, friendly claims staff has become a key way companies try to set themselves apart. So, they are both trying to have great customer service, while also trying to make sure a claim is covered by a policy and isn’t fraudulent or misreported.

The key person responsible for most of this is the **Claims Adjuster**. This person gathers all the information about a claim and interacts with the person who experienced a loss.

Insurance companies normally only have a limited staff of Adjusters, and it is not uncommon for claims adjusters to work several dozen claims at any one time. 

## Primary Goal
BriteCore’s clients want a design that a claims manager can use to assign adjusters to all open claims that meets the following conditions:

* The design is efficient to use, as claims managers have limited time themselves, and there can be many claims they have to assign.
* The design helps inform the claims manager, by showing them relevant workload metrics for adjusters. This could include things like **Average number of claims**.
* While assigning a claim, the claims manager will know the following information about it: **Claim Number**, **Loss Date & Time**, **Description**, **Loss Address**.

We would like to see a set of low-fidelty mockups/sketches showing approaches for how you would design this feature. We would also like to see a high-fidelity mockup of one of these approaches. 

### Delivery

Your final deliverables will be:
* Images of low-fidelity sketches/mockups and hi-fidelity final design.
* Any other documentation that helps us understand how you work.

Please share progress along the way. We are most interested in seeing how you work as a designer and tackle challenges.
