# Design Team Project

Thank you for taking time to do our design test. It is inspired by a real world design problem we faced and includes two parts: 

* The design test
* A few followup questions

Please submit this project as a `.zip` file back to the design team lead, Will Guldin (will@britecore.com). The zip file should contain a `.md` file with your answers and a high fidelty design file of your choice.

## The Design Test

BriteCore uses a "community source" model, which means any of our clients can see our source code and make contributions that can be used by the entire client community (similar to an open source project). Below is a basic mockup for a new feature a client's developer wants to add to the system. This feature is called a **Replacement Cost Estimator**. In home insurance, these estimators are used to calculate the value of a home, so that the correct amount of insurance can be given to the end customer. 

It's hard for customers to estimate the replacement cost of their homes, so instead, they will answer the following questions below, and then an algorithm used by the client will determine the replacement cost. 

Below is the form design they want to use for collecting this information.

Come up with a high fidelty version of this design that contains any changes you can think of to improve the UX and UI of this feature. Specific wording, ordering of questions, layout changes, and anything else can be proposed.

### Considerations
* Once all information is entered, a replacement cost can automatically be fetched and updated, or this could also be triggered by a user action.
* This is just a single component widget in a larger application, no need to worry about designing page navigation, footer information, etc. 
* Brand the UI however you wish, so long as your final mockup is polished and professional.
* The person using this interface will be an insurance agent getting a policy for the customer. It won't be the homeowner who is directly completing this form.

### User Story
As an agent using BriteCore,
I am able to quickly get a replacement cost estimate for my customer,
so that they can have the correct amount of homeowner's insurance.

### Requirements
Take as much or as little time as you would like to complete the following requirements:
* Your design meets the user story outlined above. 
* All the same data as the original mockup is collected in your design.
* You have a high-fidelity version of your design completed.

*Optional: If you sketched different approaches, those can also be submitted, but this is not required.*

## Followup Questions
1. How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time? 
2. Describe what you see as the biggest change you made to improve usability of this design. 
3. Would you be able to code a prototype of this design using HTML and CSS?
4. What typeface best describes your personality?
