# Design Team Project

Thank you for taking time to do our design test. It is inspired by a real world design problem we faced and includes two parts: 

* The design test
* A few followup questions

Please submit this project as a zip file back to the design team lead, Will Guldin (will@britecore.com). The zip file should contain a .md file with your answers and a high fidelty design.

## The Design Test

BriteCore uses a ‘community source’ model, which means any of our clients can see our source code and make contributions that can be used by the entire community (similar to an open source project). Below is a basic mockup for a new feature a client developer wants to add to the system. This feature is called a 'Replacement Cost Estimator'. In home insurance, these estimators are used to calculate the value of a home, so that the correct amount of insurance can be given to the end customer. 

It's hard for customers to estimate the replacement cost of their homes, so instead, they will answer the following questions below, and then an algorithm used by the client will determine the replacement cost. 

Below is the form design they want to use for collecting this information.



Come up with a high fidelty version of this design that contains any improvements you can think of to improve the UX of this feature. Specific wording, ordering of questions, and anything else can be proposed as a change.

### Considerations
* Once all information is entered, a replacement cost can automatically be fetched and updated, but this could also be triggered by a user action.
* This is just a single component widget in a larger application, no need to worry about designing page navigation, footer information, etc. 
* Brand the UI however you wish, so long as your UI is polished and professional.

## Followup Questions

1. How long did you spend on the test? What 
2. Describe what you see as the biggest change you made to improve usability of this design.
