# Analytics Engineer Hiring Project

Thank you for taking time to do our coding test. It is inspired by a real world analytics problem we faced and includes two parts:

The coding test
A few followup questions

Please submit this project as a pull request back to this repo. The PR should include your code and answers to the follow up questions.

## The Coding Test

### Overview
Our frontend team has almost completed a UI rewrite of one of the oldest, and most used pages in our application. The billing page is used to look up a policy's billing information, past transactions and payment plan options. The team has left the backend logic unchanged, but has updated the frontend to use vue.js and our [design system](ui.britecore.com).

We originally chose this page for a UI rewrite because our user research indicated that it had many pain points. Although we kept functionality the same for this initial refactor, our goal is to now use the rewritten page as a base for future improvements. 

To know if this effort is successful or not, we decided to try and measure a few key metrics, with one being time spent on page. Several clients said it took too long to find information on the current page. 

Measuring this proved more difficult than we expected, and we'd like to see how you would approach the problem.

### Project 

Build a simple frontend SPA in the language of your choice. The main page should have one primary action, and several secondary actions that could be taken. 

Add analytics tracking to this page to determine how long a user is spending on this page. Google Analytics currently does offer Average Time on Page as a top-line statistic, but in many cases, as we found, it can be unreliable. We're curious how you'd approach getting us an accurate measurement for this important metric.

Assume that we haven't decided if we're sticking with Google Analytics, and that we may want to change out the framework in the future.

### Follow Up Questions
1. How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time?
2. Is there anything else you would recommend we track on this page?
4. Describe yourself in JSON (separate file for this is fine)
