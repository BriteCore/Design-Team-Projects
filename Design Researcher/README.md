# Design Researcher Project

Thank you for taking time to do our design test. It is inspired by a real world design problem we faced and includes two parts:

* The design research test
* A few followup questions

Please submit this project as a .zip file back to the design director, Will Guldin (will@britecore.com). The zip file should contain a .md file with your answers and a research plan, in PDF format.

## The Design Research Test

BriteCore is essentially a CMS for insurance companies. They use our web-based software to manage all aspects of their business, including customer policies and claims that have been filed. With thousands of records, a robust search tool is critical for any user trying to locate a record in the system. We’re currently in the process of rebuilding several of the modules of BriteCore, including our claims app, which tracks and records insurance claims.

To aid in searching for a claim, we’re planning to use our existing search component. This component already includes traditional filters to limit results, as seen below:

#### Search Component

#### Search Component w/ Active Filter

We’re also considering an approach where someone searching for a claim can scope or limit their search results.

#### Search Component with Scoping Dropdown Active

This feature would allow the user to narrow down how their search results are interpreted to match certain categories of data. We think this might be most useful for searching for partial records. A claim number is normally formatted like C-2018-52312. So, if you were searching ‘52312’ only, we think it might be helpful to limit your search to ‘claim number’ so that phone numbers like “532-127-5555” don’t show up as well. The ‘all’ option will try its best to match results from all data categories.

We’d like to better understand how our users might use a search tool like this, and would be curious what types of research questions and methodology you would ask to get a better understanding of this goal.

Please come up with a research plan that would test the effectiveness of both high-level and low-level concepts here.

### Considerations
* The main people using this area of our app will be claims adjusters. Adjusters work inside an insurance company to document and record all aspects of the claim, and what happened. They also decide how much the insurance company should pay to the person filing the claim.
* Typically, they have a large workload of up to 100 claims at a given time they are working on.
* Any methodology that you feel is appropriate can be included in your project plan.
* We’re mostly interested in assessing how you approach and advocate for design research within a company.

### Requirements
Take as much or as little time as you would like to complete the following requirements:

* A project plan that describes how you would research the problems outlined above.
* The plan should also include details into how you would share this research with the rest of the team or incorporate it into a design process.

## Followup Questions
1. How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time?
2. What aspect of your plan do you see as being the most important to it being successfully executed?
3. What methods specifically related to remote research did you leverage?
